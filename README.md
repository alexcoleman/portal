Vegashack project - Feb 2013

This project uses OpenTok and Twilio API's to create 2-way video conferencing with messenging powered by text message. The idea is to have several portals all over Vegas to enable connections without having to physically be present. 

One example would be to have an open portal somewhere Downtown, and another in a popular suburban area to promote activities happening Downtown or vice versa.
